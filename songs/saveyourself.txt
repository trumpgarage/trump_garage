It weighs heavier on one's heart
I could tell right from the start that
Sweeter ones are hard to come across
Well there is more than meets the eye
Heart like yours is rare to find
Someone else's gain will be my loss

Woah, woah, oh oh
Oh woah, woah
Woah woah oh
Hey hey

Little things that make you smile
Dancing barefoot in the dark
If only I had strength to change your mind
Oh for what you need
You will not seek
Choose your words before you speak
Can you see that all you've got is time?

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Oh darlin' save yourself for someone else
Yeah, save yourself
Oh darlin' save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself for someone else

Woah
Don't give in to that feeling
Don't give in darkness and faith, yeah
You should be safe, yeah, with someone else

Tell your secrets to the night
You do yours and I do mine
So we won't have to keep them all inside
Oh, for one so pure
Can't be sold
Don't let your feelings take control
Hold on to the one thing he's begging for

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Go on and save yourself for someone else
Yes darlin' save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
So go on and save yourself for someone else

Woah are you gonna break?
Yeah are you gonna break?
Woah what's it gonna take?
Yeah are you gonna break?
Woah are you gonna break?
Woah are you going to break?
Woah what's it gonna take?
Yeah are you gonna break?

Are you gonna break?
Are you gonna break?
Are you gonna break?
