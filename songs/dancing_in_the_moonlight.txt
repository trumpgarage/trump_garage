We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose they keep it tight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin in the moonlight
We get it almost everynight
when that moon is big and bright
it's a supernatural delight
everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
